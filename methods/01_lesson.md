Unit : Computer Science   Collaborators: Saranii M, Jerusha T, Maxwell Y, Greg S
Breakout Room 4, Friday Jul 15, 2022
Lesson : 3		
Title: Debugging with SCRATCH

Materials: 
Computers
Code.org
Google classroom


Agenda:
Entry Slip/discuss
Model
We do 
Lesson 3 - in Code Studio
Exit Slip 


Standards: CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards
1A-AP-11 - Decompose (break down) the steps needed to solve a problem into a precise sequence of instructions.
LT: SWBAT predict where a program fails and modify the program to solve the errors. 




Lesson Plan
Tech Tools / Notes
3 min
Entry Slip: There is a bug in the program … Scrat can’t get to the acorn. Why can’t he? How can you fix it? 
** Ask students to heart the ones they think will work


Collaborate board
Interactive hearts


5 min
Entry Slip Share
See which had most hearts - 
 Conclude for kids whether their favorite is correct then go to breakouts

HOW did you figure out what was wrong in the entry slip? ONE of you will be sharing your groups ideas with the class when we come back to the whole class
Key person depends on attendance



See NEarpod - can be used and virtually
3
Vocab
What do you think a bug is in coding?
Then what does it mean to debug?

A bug is: 
Part of a program that does not work as it is meant to 
Debug
Find and fix the problems in your algorithm or program




5
min
Model/- model puzzle 2 - they watch as I use the step tool to find bug and model thinking

We do -
Kids do lesson 3 in groups and help each other. 
Ask - what should we do first? Second? Third? 
Have kids talk through - encourage all voices to be heard. 
Do live puzzle #2 in code studio go over using Step tool

*** Remind FDL /MLL of language tool - FDL MUST use French 

Other MLL get choice.. 

Do lesson 3 
Use thinking and step tool . 
5min
You Do (alone) - 
MUST do levels 4-5 - Dark green - ms light green - as white - ns - meeting standard
TRY to do levels 6-7 -a little above standard
If you finish early: 
Try the challenge (level 8 & 10) - above standard 


Use dashboard to check work
Available for questions
TBD
Extension Activity:
For students who complete the assignment before their peers Challenge students to create a customized maze using graph paper and a  randomly selected set of code blocks. 


10 min
Exit Slip: Time to climb (one question to assess grasp of concept)

As well as How did you feel about the lesson (emotional gauge)





Related Services: 
Paras will restate multi step directions as needed. Reinforce named vocab. Remodel use of step tool if needed to ensure students can continue with self-discovery.

Differentiation/Mods/Supports:
Extension for advanced: Level 8 (challenging)/Lesson Extras
Supports: Levels 3&4 - Beg
                     Levels 5-7 - Int
                     Levels 9-10 - int/adv

MLL:  Explicit vocab building - bug and debug
            Language tool - FDL - Using code.org in French
                                           Other MLL may change to native language if they          
                                           choose



HW: Finish remaining levels in Lesson + Lesson Extras if possible from wherever you left off


Student Progress tracking:
 The digital platform (code.org) has an LMS that allows me to see both the progress of the students as well as the code they write for each specific level within each lesson which allows me to re-group and re-teach.
