CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
-- Understands how the computer processes information (steps and order) and leads to the construction of cleaner code and the ability to identufy and explain logic, approach and where to debugg if code results in errors.



CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
-- In complex situations the trace can be hard to follow due to multiple approaches in the development of for example psudeo code vs diagrams.

BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>
-- Recursion
-- Loops
-- Methods
-- Variable Assignment
-- Array


LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
-- In my experince working with markup language as storyboards are used to illustrate processand end goals. Live coding can be a challenge if the errors are not caught early and students can be mislead to frustration when code does not execute as anticipated.


PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 Anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
 * etc 
>
-- debugging
-- color coding
-- bracket types
