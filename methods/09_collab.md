YOUR BREAKOUT MISSION (30min):
SCENARIO:

It is the first time you are introducing a particular collaboration technique to your students.
 
GOAL: Gain deeper/wider awareness of best time/setting in which to introduce a collaboration technique, as well as how to assess whether it is working. Codify this understanding into a document for your future use.
 
TASK: To be done individually, but in the company of your teammates, for inspiration & productivity purposes…
 
Select an assignment from a class you have taught or will teach that you would like to incorporate group work into.
 
ASSIGNMENT: Using CSS markup language to create a circle on the popcode text editor.
 
Select a group work approach/technique most suitable
 
Pair Grouping emphasizing the driver/navigator approach
 
Flesh out the "teacher-facing" parts of this assignment to address specifics how the group work component will be worked in. Address these, at minimum:
 
What are the intended benefits of group work over solo work?
Pairing students of differing abilities to encourage collaboration and peer to peer support in a common (peer) language to increase understandings and enhance ownership of materials in a collaborative environment.
 
Mechanisms for gauging how well it is working?
Circumnavigating the classroom to listen and observe paired student exchanges. Observing that students are engaged, communicating and working equitably, signals that the collaborative environment of a pairing is functioning and is providing empowering experience. Teacher will support, and guide however it is imperative that the experience is student led.
 
Initiating with an unplugged approach would foster the roles and expectations of the paired grouping to accomplish the task. Perhaps initializing activity by having student pairs "trace" or write a small algorithm to describe the steps needed to turn a square piece of construction paper into a circle. Next, providing a pair of students with a square piece of construction paper, a scissor and instructing them to create a circle out of the square in a timed setting. Observing the communication between students will alter any adjustment that would make the pairing a fruitful and successful experience.
 
What to do when trouble erupts... (resistance to a grouping, lack of buy-in, "dead-weight" teammates, know-it-alls, etc.)
Teacher must pre-anticipate and know their audience. Creating an environment of support, respect and walkabouts, reduces stress and sets a precedence of expectations. Thus, established incentives like free tech time (Computer Lab Free Time during Lunch), homework free night pass, skip a quiz, and home compliment callscan discourage “trouble”. Dispatch non-working students as a mouse team helper to another group or join the group as a member to guide cooperation and collaboration and assist in “ironing out” miscommunications.
 
What instructions/guidance will students get re: the group work mechanics?
Instructions and guidance would be provided on the smartboard, verbally reinforced and illustrated on distributed assignment entrance or exit tickets. Teacher must demo and repetitively check and walk students through the expectations and etiquette of pair sharing prior to lesson to iron out obstacles to successful implementation. In addition, offer opt outs allowing the students to partner with the teacher to boost confidence and avoid miscommunications. 

What long-term or class-wide goals does this support, and how?
Long-term or class-wide goals supported are collaboration, peer support. perseverance problem solving and 21st century career readiness goals. With emphasis on the actuality that while you may not like your work peers but you must find a way to work with them to achieve common goals. The expectation of students and the maintenance of a supportive and collaborative work/class environment must be established from day one to maintain an environment of excellence, endurance and collaboration.
